# Neovim Configuration
## Plugin Manager
Using `Packer` as the plugin manager (with bootstrapping).

## latex
you need a pdf viewer + texlive, here zathura is used. Remove if you do not want to use vimtex

## TODO
- [x] use a different plugin manager

## First Time Setup
If you want to install the minimal version:
```
git clone -b minimal --depth 1 https://github.com/when-q/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
Or you can clone the one that I'm currently using
```
git clone -b main --depth 1 https://github.com/when-q/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

# Additional Notes
Optional: Install ripgrep to make telescope happy
