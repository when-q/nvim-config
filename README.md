# Neovim Configuration
## Plugin Manager
Using `Lazy` as the plugin manager (with bootstrapping).

## First Time Setup
If you want to install the minimal version:
```
git clone -b main --depth 1 https://github.com/when-q/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
Or you can clone the one that I'm currently using
```
git clone -b personal --depth 1 https://github.com/when-q/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

# Additional Notes
Optional: Install rg to make telescope happy
